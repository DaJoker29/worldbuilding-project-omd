**Rictavio's Hideout**
Flat marshy lakefront. Old tower, decrepit. Collapsing scaffold. Large gash. Covered in moss. Parked near the base within sight of the entrance. A single mud-covered wagon.

Nobu gave us some goodberries.

Fresh coat of purple paint. Steel padlock. Cheap wooden sign. "Keep out!"

Rin and Friend search Rictavio's tower. They find a decapitated head.

Adi throws a dagger at the side of the wagon. Friend and Rin break open lock. Wagon blows up.

We start a long rest.
