**Personal History**
Almost 12 years ago, a stranger arrived in town with her infant daughter bundled in her arms. The woman claimed her days were numbered as a devil had marked her soul for collection. The community took in the two but, as predicted, the mother was found slain weeks later.

The child, Asma, was raised by the townsfolk—eventually finding her place as an assistant to a local seamstress. As she grew older, Asma showed a knack for the arcane which she quickly embraced. Soon, she was reading every tome she could place her hands on, hoping to expand her knowledge of the arcane.

Despite a shy peculiarity, many of the townsfolk find her quite charming. Though some find it disconcerting that she chooses to stay in the abandoned halls of the haunted [[Xenavere Manor]].
# Secret
What few know about Asma is that the fiendish monster who killed her mother never left town. In fact, they remain here—trapped inside Asma's mind.

No one else was there to witness when the incubus arrived for Asma's mother, Francesca. No one but the 1-year-old Asma herself and she was too young to recall what happened exactly after the fiend claimed her mother. But through some unknown circumstance—perhaps an early showing of her innate powers—the incubus found his body destroyed and his soul imprisoned within the young infant's mind.

The incubus has since then tormented Asma with waking nightmares—hoping a crack in her psyche will provide an opportunity for escape. Meanwhile, she searches tirelessly for ways to undo this parasitic bond so she may destroy him, once and for all.

It turns out this bond is why she resides in [[Xenavere Manor]]. The overwhelming necrotic energy from the geists and ghouls within create a buffer through which the incubus's illusions cannot penetrate.
