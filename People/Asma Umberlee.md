**Personal History**
Almost 12 years ago, a stranger arrived in town with her infant daughter bundled in her arms. The woman claimed her days were numbered as a devil had marked her soul for collection. The community took in the two but, as predicted, the mother was found slain weeks later.

The child, Asma, was raised by the townsfolk—eventually finding her place as an assistant to a local seamstress. As she grew older, Asma showed a knack for the arcane which she quickly embraced. Soon, she was reading every tome she could place her hands on, hoping to expand her knowledge of the arcane.

Despite a shy peculiarity, many of the townsfolk find her quite charming. Though some find it disconcerting that she chooses to stay in the abandoned halls of the haunted [[Xenavere Manor]].
# Secret
What few know about Asma is that the fiendish monster who killed her mother never left town. In fact, they remain here—trapped inside Asma's mind.

No one else was there to witness when the incubus arrived for Asma's mother, Francesca. No one but the 1-year-old Asma herself. She was too young to recall what happened after the fiend claim Francesca's soul. But through some unknown circumstance—perhaps an early showing of her innate magical power—the incubus found his body unmade and his soul imprisoned within the young girls

Through some unknown circumstance, after claiming the soul of her mother the Incubus became ensnared within the mind of a two-year old—perhaps an early showing of her innate magical force. Since then, he has tormented her with waking nightmares in the hopes that cracking her psyche will provide him an opportunity to escape. Meanwhile, she scours any magical tomes she can find for ways to destroy him.

This is why she resides in [[Xenavere Manor]] as the overwhelming psychic energy from their necrotic undeadness creates a buffer through which the fiend and his illusions cannot penetrate. She has also built a friendly bond with some of the skeletons, ghouls, and ghasts who parade around the mansion.
