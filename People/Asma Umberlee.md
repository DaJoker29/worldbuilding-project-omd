**Personal History**
Almost 12 years ago, a stranger arrived in town with her infant daughter bundled in her arms. The woman claimed her days were numbered as a devil had marked her soul for collection. The community took in the two , however, as predicted the mother was found dead a few weeks later.

The young girl (Asma) was raised by shopkeepers and farmers in the area—eventually finding her place as an assistant to a local seamstress. She also began to develop a knack for the arcane which she bolstered through a steady habit of reading.

Despite her shyness, many find her quite charming. Though some find the fact that she stays in the haunted [[Xenavere Manor]] quite disconcerting.

**Secret**
What no one knows about Asma is that the devil who killed her mother never left town. In fact, he remains here, trapped inside Asma's mind.

Through some unknown circumstance, after claiming the soul of her mother the Incubus became ensnared within the mind of a two-year old—perhaps an early showing of her innate magical force. Since then, he has tormented her with waking nightmares in the hopes that cracking her psyche will provide him an opportunity to escape. Meanwhile, she scours any magical tomes she can find for ways to destroy him.

This is why she resides in [[Xenavere Manor]] as the overwhelming psychic energy from their necrotic undeadness creates a buffer through which the fiend and his illusions cannot penetrate. She has also built a friendly bond with some of the skeletons, ghouls, and ghasts who parade around the mansion.
