1. Bonus Proficiencies (Level 3)

You’ve learned to adapt to the foreign elements of other realms and planets. Choose two additional tool proficiencies or languages from any plane or culture. You also gain proficiency with Arcana, as you’ve learned to understand the magic and power of the worlds you steal from.

2. Shard Stealer (Level 3)

Your connection to the dying god allows you to siphon a fragment of power from the otherworldly places it absorbs. Once per short rest, when you deal Sneak Attack damage, you may choose one of the following effects based on the type of world or plane you are drawing from: 
- Elemental Surge: Infuse your attack with energy from an elemental plane. Your Sneak Attack deals an additional 1d6 elemental damage (choose fire, cold, lightning, or acid).
- Astral Blink: You briefly phase into the Astral Plane, becoming ethereal until the end of your next turn. During this time, attacks against you have disadvantage. 
- Shadow Veil: Call upon a piece of the Shadowfell to cloak yourself. You become invisible until the start of your next turn.
