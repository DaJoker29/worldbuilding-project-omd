## The Wandering
- Starts at 14. Leave Aquanos for 5 years and bring back knowledge. At that time, choice to "fully join" society.
	- Offered a tear to the Falls and gained an Microtopus
	- At 21, we add a drop of blood to the falls of truth, adding to the communities well of knowledge.
- Ingesting the sea, including the eggs of a tiny octopus. Our Rumspringa type thing. If it dies, it can't be resummoned. Bound to us for life. Can provide benefits but also detriments if it dies.
	- Death of these octopuses is looked down upon.
- We each have our own octopus. We are psionically bound.
