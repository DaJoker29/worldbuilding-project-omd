## The Wandering
- Starts at 14
- Ingesting the sea, including the eggs of a tiny octopus. Our Rumspringa type thing. If it dies, it can't be resummoned. Bound to us for life. Can provide benefits but also detriments if it dies.
	- Death of these octopuses is looked down upon.
- We each have our own octopus. We are psionically bound.
