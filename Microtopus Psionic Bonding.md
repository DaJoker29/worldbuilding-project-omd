Mechanical Effects for the Microctopus Bond 

Psionic Bond (Telepathy) 
The host gains the ability to communicate telepathically with their microctopus over a range of 60 feet. This allows silent communication with the microctopus, which in turn can transmit sensory information or emotional impressions. At higher levels, this range might increase, and the telepathic bond could extend to humanoid allies as well. Psionic Powers 

At 1st Level: The host gains access to minor psionic abilities. Once per long rest, the microctopus can assist its host in casting Detect Thoughts or Message without the need for components. 

At 5th Level: The connection strengthens, allowing the microctopus to help the host cast Suggestion once per long rest as a psionic ability. 

At 10th Level: The microctopus can bolster its host with more powerful psionics, allowing the use of Telekinesis once per long rest. Shared Senses The microctopus can, for a number of minutes equal to its host's level per day, share its senses with the host. This allows the host to perceive through the microctopus’ eyes, which may be particularly useful for scouting or detecting invisible creatures. The microctopus can see in both dim light and darkness, making it an invaluable asset for night missions. Skill Proficiency (Insight) The Tear of Truth granted during the rite enhances the host’s perception of truth and deception. The host gains proficiency in Insight. If already proficient, they gain expertise (doubling their proficiency bonus) in this skill. Symbiotic Resilience The psionic connection grants the host a measure of resilience. Once per short rest, when the host takes psychic damage, they can reduce the damage by an amount equal to their proficiency bonus plus their Intelligence modifier, as the microctopus dampens the psychic assault. The host may also become resistant to psychic damage at higher levels, making them harder to manipulate or harm through mental means. Psionic Reflexes    

The microctopus, being ever-watchful of its host's safety, can react to danger. Once per long rest, if the host fails a Dexterity saving throw, the microctopus can give them advantage on the roll as a reaction. This bond also improves at higher levels, allowing this benefit to be used more often or applying to other saving throws such as Wisdom (e.g., against Charm or Fear). Companion Action (Help) The microctopus, while small and physically limited, can provide the host with subtle aid in combat. It can use the Help action on the host’s turn, assisting with a task like picking a lock, spotting danger, or distracting an enemy during an attack. At higher levels, this ability might improve to allow the microctopus to give its host advantage on attack rolls or checks a set number of times per long rest. Bond of Longevity The microctopus, due to its deep connection with the host, extends the host’s lifespan. For each 10 years the host lives, they only age 5 years. This subtle effect could also extend to provide the host with advantage on Constitution saving throws against exhaustion, disease, or the effects of old age. Emotional Shield The host and the microctopus share emotions, allowing the octopus to sense when its host is in mental or emotional distress. Once per long rest, the host can gain advantage on a saving throw against charm, fear, or other mind-altering effects as the microctopus strengthens their emotional defenses. Aquatic Adaptation Due to the microctopus’ aquatic origins, the host gains a swim speed equal to their walking speed and can breathe underwater for 1 hour per long rest. At higher levels, this duration increases or even becomes permanent.
