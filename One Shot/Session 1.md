**Date**: August 1st, 2024

**Session**: Elemental chaos. The world was created and people were forced to fight with each other for the little bits of land that existed. More and more land blipped into existence.

Tornadoes, hurricanes, and lightning storms. It starts to settle around year 6 or 7. The landscape shifts constantly, deserts finding deserts. Chaos.

**Shadric Oberon**
Shadric is teleported here with one of his targets. He begins rebuilding his order once more.

**Jack Firejumper (Fireslayer)**
Leader of a crew with the same hand tattoo. Always has a plan. Use to be petty thieves. Make sure people have enough. Merry Men-complex.

Jack (nondescript, dirty brown blonde hair, not super tall, brings a presence, center of attention)
Jen (super hot, cold towards people, don't take shit from no one)
Ven (short cropped, dirty brown, hot-headed)
Von (shy guy)
