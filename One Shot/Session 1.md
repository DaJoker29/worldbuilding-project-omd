**Session**: Elemental chaos. The world was created and people were forced to fight with each other for the little bits of land that existed. More and more land blipped into existence.

Tornadoes, hurricanes, and lightning storms. It starts to settle around year 6 or 7. The landscape shifts constantly, deserts finding deserts. Chaos.
