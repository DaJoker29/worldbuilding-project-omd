# Backstory
Pops was a minotaur, Mom was an elf. People ask me how that…happened? Your guess is as good as mine and, quite frankly, I don’t want to picture that. All I know is a bunch of months later, I showed up. They say I inherited my mother’s looks and my father’s personality. But I also inherited something else from him as well. *taps her horns.*
  
Mom died when I was about six. Um, she was a jewelry appraiser for the mining district. Killed when a bunch of bandits tried raiding their vault. It shook things up for me and I handled it the best I could…which is to say poorly. Dad tried to hold it all together but he was too busy with the Church by that time.

When Pops was younger, he and his missionary friends would cart food and supplies out to the druid tribes in the desert and give it away. One time he got separated in a sandstorm. He said he took shelter in a ruined temple which had been unearthed by the storm. He claimed there were writings of an ancient, forgotten goddess known as Ashryn the Firebrand. Desperate for food and water, he knelt down to pray to her. According to him, an angel appeared. An angel named Emberica. They sheltered him from death, and guided him back to civilization. 

As you can imagine, he was changed after that. Dad spent years building the Cathedral in honor of Ashryn. When he wasn’t working, he was out spreading the word of this new deity. Eventually, he began to grow a small flock. But as his congregation grew, some outsiders began to worry of his growing influence. Some leaders from the other faiths began calling him a con artist and a cult leader. They accused him of taking advantage of his followers with a made-up story of a made-up deity. Jealous pricks.

At that point, I was too caught up in my own drama to care. I was 16 and hanging out with “the wrong crowd”. Eventually, I got arrested for petty theft bullshit and sentenced to a few weeks in the dungeons. Dad was furious but he got over it. He said he just wanted to see me get out of there safe. Little did I know it was his safety we should’ve been worried about.

According to the witnesses, they say walls of stone sprang up around the exits of the Cathedral during the evening service one night. Then flames and explosions engulfed the building. The screams, they say, could be heard across the entire district.

And like that, my father, his church, and most of his congregation were gone. I returned home to find a pile of ashes. Luckily, Baldric Ironbeard took me in. A blacksmith and one of my father’s deacons. It was shaky at first. I had a lot of anger and resentment that I didn’t know what to do with. But Baldric showed me an outlet: The furnace and anvil.

Metalworking felt like the thing that had always been missing in my life. Something about the soot in the air and the smell of hot iron just felt right. And soon, I began to see sparks of something…something divine in the pieces I worked. Sometimes it was like I wasn’t even building, it felt like I would walk away and when I came back the sword or helm or breastplate I was envisioning was just sitting there on the workbench, perfectly constructed.

It took me a while to realize that this was the influence of the Firebrand, Ashryn. She has chosen me for a reason I couldn’t hope to explain. But I think that there is only one thing that she could want from me. One thing I would be capable of accomplishing. Spreading her name. To show her eternal strength to the world that had forgotten her. It’s the only reason that makes sense to me.

Because of that, Baldric’s been pestering me to rebuild the Cathedral. Its charred remains still sit there, a stain on the hypocritical religious sector. He wants me to lead a new flock. He says he is in contact with other followers, people who still believe in Ashryn, but they have simply gone underground, afraid of being persecuted.

Maybe one day but I can’t do that now. If I did it would end the same way. And I can’t have that one my conscience. No, I must prove the goddess’s existence first. I must prove that my father preached the truth and that those who ostracized and murdered him were truly the evil ones. And there is only one way to do that. I must find that lost temple in the desert.
