Smell of fresh air like the wilderness

Market in the middle of the city.
no trash, guards on 15 minute patrols

a makeshift shack in the shadow of hte biggest building in town (the Paramount Church)

Dag's Tinks

**Dag** — Goliath Artificer
> 7" tall. No head room.
Intimidating.

**Ryan** — Golem
> Equally tall, even larger. Unsettling.
> Covered in moss and elegant blue glowing script on surface.
