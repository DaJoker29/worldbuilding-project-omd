Commandments from the Benevalent God
Unite all 3 factions: 
Glorious Plains
Solar Gardens
Desolate Badlands

500 Years Ago
- Three more cherished artifacts of this land.
- Nobody knows where they are.
- Bring them to Icarus Peak (Volcano in the middle of the lake). Place them on the old pedastals. The lands and people will flourish. He will grant us each a wish.
