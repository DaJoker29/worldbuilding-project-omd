	- Adi grabs one with a divination magic.
	- Friend's potions â€” fire related, other smells like fresh lime.
	- Bonk grabs 5, Rin grabs 10 random potions.

	- False bottom: large tome with thick leather binding, depiction of a wizened looking man with a gem in his forehead.

- Pidlwick opens another room. Giant frog thing appears and we fight it again.
