# Start Here
- We joke about leveling up. We talk about mustard.
- Taking a long rest.
- Long conversation about consent.
- We roll for things. Adi isn't willing for the ceremony so the ritual doesn't work.

### Long Rest
**New Portent**: `[17][18]`

Clearish morning. Looming mountains. We don't know where Virion is. Just a general direction.

- Cursed Pokeball is primed. He can use it to trap something maybe.

- We walk towards the mountains. Delban sends an ice flare to guide us.
- Nobu removes Adi's curse.
- We find Virion near a cliffside. He flies Adi and Friend up the mountain.
	- Virion threatens Adi about casting fire magic.
- Adi still surprised people consider Delban a god.
- We cross the bridge and a mysterious stranger appears. Friend wants to go fight them. We argue with him (even though Kyle isn't here).
- We enter a snowstorm. ***Adi casts Mage Armor.***
