**Start Here**

- Veyllis casts Bless on Friend, Bonk, and Adi.
- Adi dives into Delban's mind around the ritual.

**Notes for Next Session**:
- Adi has accepted too many dark bargains. Power for obedience is no power at all. Maybe they should try Nobu's tact, and approach things with a little faith...Faith in themselves, faith in each other. No more deals with dark powers.
- This place is a safe haven from Strahd. If they clear it, it can serve as a base to plan their assault on Castle Ravenloft (the map room).
- They don't need Delban's dark bargain. They should keep Delban locked away.
