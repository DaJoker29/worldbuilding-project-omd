AC 11 / HP 19

- Rythm pissed off Joe with the ads last week. 
- I live when I rot, and I sing when I’m swarmed. I am eaten when I’m dead, but I still eat you when I’m alive. What am I? (Corpse)
- Bright at birth, gasping in age. I feed on breath, and death snuffs me all the same. What am I? (Fire)

I take without teeth.
I choke without hands.
I hold you when you sink,
and release you when you rot.
What am I? (Swamp)

- "Break the magic around us and I can rest." - Heron

- Skull saying words on ribs.
- HE returned to Barovia and all bent the knee before him.
- I caught the babe as he slipped into the world. His first scream, mine to hear.
- He killed his brother and death kissed him eternal
- The Zarovich line was powerful and they called for me when the blood was thin.
- He looked upon Tatyiana and his heart was not his own.
- I nursed him in shadow and blood and yet the world calls me monster.
- He became a solider and ocnquer draped in steel and fire.
