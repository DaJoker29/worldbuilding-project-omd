**Starting Here**
- The road doubles back over itself as it climbs far beneath our feet we can see the road before the crossroads. It's not long however before the lower road vanishes from sight. High road mounting a snow covered plane.
- Gate house. Luna river. 1000 ft. below.
- Adi ties himself to Delban. Delban casts Fly. Delban carries Adi. Bonk carries Pidlwick and Veyllis. Friend thundersteps with Rin and then Rin flies with Friend.
- Bless on Bonk, Friend, Veyllis, and Rin.
- Trevor showed up.
- Fork in the road: Moaning to the east, blood trail to the south, nothing to the west.
- We go towards moaning and find a pile of bones. Adi beguns animating skeletons while others move ahead.
- They get ambushed by a creepy looking undead thing. Another one crept up behind Pidlwick.

**Note**: A human skeleton weighs about 10.5lbs. If I carry a sack with two skeletons, it'll weigh about 21lbs.
- When not exploring, Adi's skeletons collapse into piles of bones and he stores them in sacks.
