***Long Rest***
- Delban, a great evil, has been released. Virion is concerned about how powerful.
- Virion and Adi are going to think about the Delban problem in the background while the others 
- Step outside and Diana has been turned into a giant spider. Meta and Coreolus appear dead and covered in webs.
	- Spiders pop out of the body.
- Virion still seems afraid of fire.
- Adi uses the spider corpses to rebuild the corpses and reanimates them into zombies. (Coreolanis / Metta)
