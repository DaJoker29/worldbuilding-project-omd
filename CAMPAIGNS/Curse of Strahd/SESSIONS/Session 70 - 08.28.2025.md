**Initiative**

**Start Here**
- Kyle has retired from his role as notetaker. I take over the role.

- Hag witch bitch materializes and the illusionary facade drops. We stand in a swamp, baby. The people are scarecrows.

**Roll Initiative**
- The swamp is filled with fog. Heavily obscured.
- Friend casts Fireball at the Goats but she counterspells it all.
- She turns Virion fugly.
- She is hidden from divination.
- Nobu Turns Undead but the scarecrows are constructs.
