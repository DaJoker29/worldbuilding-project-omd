**Initiative**

**Start Here**
- Kyle has retired from his role as notetaker. I take over the role.

- Hag witch bitch materializes and the illusionary facade drops. We stand in a swamp, baby. The people are scarecrows.

**Roll Initiative**
- The swamp is filled with fog. Heavily obscured.
- Friend casts Fireball at the Goats but she counterspells it all.
- She turns Virion fugly.
- She is hidden from divination.
- Nobu Turns Undead but the scarecrows are constructs.
- She summons bone wall and her house baby wakes up
- Virion tries to bind her. Legendary Resistance used.
- Friend sends another fireball. Adi counterspells her counterspell. Fries most of the goats and scarecrows.
- Wall of Fire. Dope as fuck.
- She lands Prismatic Spray. It fucking sucks.
- Veyllis goes down but comes back up and heals a lot of folks.
- Virion gets sent to another plane of existence.
- The house dies and screams. A giant dragon skull appears and flies her around.
- Friends knocks her out of her skull. She casts a tornado to kick Adi and Bonk out. Veyllis yanks her out again.
- Acid arrows knocks out Adi. She got angry at his counterspells.
- Adi rolls a nat 20 and returns, immediately counterspelling a lightning spell.
