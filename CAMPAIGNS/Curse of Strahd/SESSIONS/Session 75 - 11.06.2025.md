**Start Here**
- Drinking and testing to see if poisonous. Purple Grape Mash (low quality) is all good. 
- Veyllis drinks from the chalice and now he can speak.
- Just-Un. Un isn't a complete name. He's being paid in wine to babysit us.
- **Wade's Note**: Virion and Bonk are on the verge of mental breakdown and Veyllis casts silence on them. They both lose it and go into an existential crisis.
- Bonk sees cloaked figures heading to the Wachter brothers.
- Veyllis tries to cast Silence to help people sleep. He says something tragic about not sleeping because he doesn't have the sound of a heart.
