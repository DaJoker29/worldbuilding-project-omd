**Start Here**
- We start towards the winery and then birds appear with a letter saying Valleki needs help.
- Virion keeps asking where Rin.
- We head back and Virion is almost grabbed by a monster in the river when we cross the broken bridge.
	- Virion is dumb.
	- Veyllis can't talk.
	- Bonk threw a javelin at us for some reason.
- 4 fresh-faced guards greet us. Dackhead (da-keed, not dickhead)
- We go to the Inn and Irwin chastises us.
- 3' tall old halfling. Un Fortuna. Son of a bitch.
	- Post-session: Veyllis might drink from the chalice to fix his missing voice thing.
