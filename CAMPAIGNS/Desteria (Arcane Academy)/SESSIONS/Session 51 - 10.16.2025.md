**START HERE**
- Almost distracted John-Alan by making him hum a song that we don't know.
- Best Case: Bonhart is captured by us.
- Worst Case: Bonhart escapes and we get hurt.
- Avoid Linneaus's brother.
- We link up with Tessa and Quentin.
- Quentin can defend himself apparently.
- Tessa does fuck. She was kind of feeling Bo until he apologized.
- Fred (Farmer 14). Daughter Mary, 11 year old tiefling.
- Incursion into the farming district. Seeking seed stock. Under King Stillshard's benevolent rule.
- King Seth Stillshard, the Astral Reaver and King of the Veiled Tower and all its Seas. King Stillshard in public, unless speaking a officer of captain or higher.
- Mary agrees to guide us around town. Niccolo is shaken by this innocent, fearful child serving so obediently.
