**START HERE**
> Death is not a gate, but a leash. 
> In love, there is power â€” and in power, ruin. 
> Life was not restored; it was rewritten. 
> Fear not the corpse that walks, but the chain that binds it. 
> Even the gentlest heart may call upon darkness. 
> So begins the unraveling.

> Drowned not in water, but in forgetting.
> In the stillness, something wakes that should not.
> Light recoils from that which walks again.
> Flesh remembers, even when the soul forgets.
> Even mercy may sour when bound in shadow.
> Should one rise, let them never look back.

> Dig not into the vessel unless you crave the scream. 
> It waited, hidden beneath sinew and spine. 
> Long did it slumber in borrowed breath. 
> From flesh was it pulled, birthing silence once more. 
> Each scream unspoken was a memory lost. 
> Stolen, it left only the hollow.
