**Party**:
- Linneaus — Father's criminal empire. Protecting his family.
- Niccolo
- Bo — Brother is being hunted.
- Axis (and Simp) — Father is missing or dead?

**Session Notes**:

- We are in the office of a pimp named Slickback. Niccolo is invisible. The pimp knows Linneaus.

**Chuck**
- Previous business with Linneaus's father.

*Flashback @ the Verplanck Manor*
- Two voices. Chuck and Linneaus's dad. A new venture. Chuck speaking proper (uncharacteristically). Papa doesn't do business with people he hasn't met face-to-face. Daughter has just been born (Abigail).
