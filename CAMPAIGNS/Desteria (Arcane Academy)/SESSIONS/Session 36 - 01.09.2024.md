**Session Notes**:

- We are in the office of a pimp named Slickback. Niccolo is invisible. The pimp knows Linneaus.

**Chuck**
- Previous business with Linneaus's father.

*Flashback @ the Verplanck Manor*
- Two voices. Chuck and Linneaus's dad (Abraham). A new venture. Chuck speaking proper (uncharacteristically). Papa doesn't do business with people he hasn't met face-to-face. Daughter has just been born (Abigail).
- Linneaus slept with a girl at the brothel and then they killed her in front of him.

- Niccolo swallow the Hag's Eye
