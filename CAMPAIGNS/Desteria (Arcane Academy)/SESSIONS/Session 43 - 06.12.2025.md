**START HERE**
- Pickles attacks us. Dunit (Dewitt's son) tells the kittens to go back inside.
- Pickles takes down Niccolo.
- Linneaus takes one of the kittens hostage.
- They offer us a ride.
- Ferry Captain Farruh gives Linneaus a druid collar.

**Ways Niccolo is sabotaging the ship**:
- Small tears in the main sails and back up sails
- Loosening the bolts on the masts
- Tainting and poisoning the water and food supply
- Fraying the lines with his dagger
- Removing the seal on gunpowder barrels
- Stealing small belongings from the crew and placing them in other people's bags.

**Note**: Linneaus has way better sleight of hand.
