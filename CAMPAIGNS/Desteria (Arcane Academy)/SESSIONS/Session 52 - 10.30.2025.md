**Initiative**

**START HERE**
- Wade and Will Ferrell have the same birthday.
- Guy holding orphan child. We roll initiative.
- Niccolo turns orange and slaughters the guy. The first kid, String, is killed.
- Ratbelly â€” Peli. The kid who survived. 
- More guards spot us. Blow on a silent horn.
- Kids didn't notice because String was the lookout.
- Niccolo creates Silence and we murk the two guards. Ratbelly leads us away as more guards come.
- Niccolo disguises as a guard to redirect them away so the party can escape.
