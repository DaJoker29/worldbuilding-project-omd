**Why**: I wish no harm upon Linneaus or his kin. But that fools looks down on us. Treats us like servants. People like him have the whole world handed to them and they think they deserve it. He thinks his success is guaranteed. People like me know that nothing is guaranteed except for what you can pry from others with your own two hands and fight to defend. And I have fought against far better foes than him. I wish to humiliate him, to dismantle everything he thinks he is owed and watch it all crumble before his eyes. And he will wonder who stole it all away from him only to realize that it was "the help".
