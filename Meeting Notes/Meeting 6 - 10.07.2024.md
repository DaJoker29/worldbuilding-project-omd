# Agenda
1. Welcome and Recap of Previous Discussions

    - Clarify any unresolved aspects (e.g., behaviors, role in the ecosystem, interactions with other factions).

	- Discuss any further elaboration on their influence over time.

4. New Discussion: The Initial Convergence

    - Consider the effect on displaced populations and lands.
