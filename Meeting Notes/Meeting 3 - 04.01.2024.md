## Questions/Comments

**Long-Term Planning**: I am not incentivized by homework assignments. I need goals, roadmaps, and milestones to push towards and measure progress against.
-  If we plan on releasing a campaign setting, maybe start with a Table of Contents/Outline of what will be inside.
- Are we going to release other content prior to that? 
- What are small proof-of-concepts we can release to test our process while also building an audience?
**Potential Roles**: Creative Lead & Business Lead
- Knowing these areas are covered and prioritized (by someone) would give me greater confidence as a contributor. 
- **Creative Lead** — Consistency and Continuity
	- Oversees/ensures continuity
	- Set Content Guidelines for consistency
		- Formats
		- Templates
		- Length
- **Business Lead** — The ABCs
	- Audience
	- Branding
	- Publishing/Monetization
