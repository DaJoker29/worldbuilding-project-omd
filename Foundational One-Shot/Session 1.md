**Date**: August 1st, 2024

**Session**: Elemental chaos. The world was created and people were forced to fight with each other for the little bits of land that existed. More and more land blipped into existence.

Tornadoes, hurricanes, and lightning storms. It starts to settle around year 6 or 7. The landscape shifts constantly, deserts finding deserts. Chaos.

**Shadric Oberon**
Shadric is teleported here with one of his targets. He begins rebuilding his order once more.

**Jack Firejumper (Fireslayer)**
Leader of a crew with the same hand tattoo. Always has a plan. Use to be petty thieves. Make sure people have enough. Merry Men-complex.

Jack (nondescript, dirty brown blonde hair, not super tall, brings a presence, center of attention)
Jen (super hot, cold towards people, don't take shit from no one)
Ven (short cropped, dirty brown, hot-headed)
Von (shy guy)

**The Council.**  We'll learn more soon.

**Captain Keyvhan**. A Goku-level Homeless Guy. Wakes up on his rooftop. Sunny beach right next to an iceberg. Community leader.

**Morgue**. Greyish-green skin. Orc. Basically a slave. Doesn't understand anything except he might now not be a slave. Fighting pit

- Rykor (tiefling, deep tan-red, circle of Duerger)

**Blipped People.** . All gathered in one area. Each have a community of about 250 people.

The **Order of Erebos** is based out of a *Threadamental Chaos*, a large textiles emporium. He and about 30 assassins are based out of there. Thrain Aldar â€” Stout dwarf, long-braided beard.

A new faction arrives. A bunch of ships.
Varyk Bronzeshade

Comes to speak with the council.

1. Establish to Arm Trade Routes vs. **Food and Medicine to our People.**

Rykor and Morg is concerned about the cutthroat. Shadric might pay him a visit in the middle of the night.

2. Trade/Production: **Luxury goods** or Essential Needs
3. Workforce: **Free Choice** or Draft
4. Settlement Focus: **Temporary Housing / Mobile (less comfortable)** vs Permanent Infrastructure (more comfortable)

Stability quakes: Landscape is shifting and causes small damage as the world tries to correct itself.

5. Dungeons: **Regulate Artifacts of Power** vs. Finders Keepers
6. Weather: **Observatory** vs Community Shelter
7. Magical Anomalies: **Containment Guild** or Leave it Free
8. Exotic Species: Sanctuary Zones or **Let the Creatures Run Wild**
9. Slavery: **Free the Slaves** or Keep them Enslaved

Divine magic doesn't work here. One person renounced his patron and gained powers again.

**Next Session:** Figure out how our characters meet.
